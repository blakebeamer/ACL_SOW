      <p>Hey Abey —</p>
      <p>Appreciate you pulling me into this — I've really enjoyed our back and forth so far. After helping out with your backyard project, we started talking about how to elevate your landscaping business online, especially around custom planter boxes. That led to some deeper exploration.</p>
      <p>A few weeks back, I mocked up a concept for a "Build Your Planter Box" landing page and walked you through the idea — a 3-step flow where customers choose their size, material, and plants. That walkthrough got us talking more seriously about SEO, site structure, brand perception, and how to position this part of your business as premium and custom. From there, I started digging into your Squarespace site and have been working through a backend audit to understand what's working, what's not, and where we can level things up.</p>
      <p>We also talked about potentially trading work (more backyard projects) in exchange for some of this creative and strategy work. So just to keep things clear and fair, this doc lays out what I'd normally charge for these services if we weren't working through a trade or friend setup. These are market-value estimates to help you see the full scope of what I can offer. None of it's set in stone — we can pick and choose, go in phases, or rework any of it. If we do decide to move forward officially, I'll turn this into a signed, itemized agreement.</p>
      <p>Let me know what stands out or what you'd want to prioritize.</p>
    </main>

    <footer class="footer">
      <h3>Timing & Availability</h3>
      <p>This is a side project I'd be taking on outside of my full-time job, which means I'll be working mostly nights and weekends. I'll be moving at a more flexible pace — especially since parts of this involve consultation, exploration, and iteration. That said, I'm available for questions or feedback along the way and happy to hop on a call or reply to anything after hours. Just shoot me a message anytime, and I'll follow up as soon as I can.</p>

      <p>And just to be transparent — my hope is that, if this all feels valuable and works out well, we could align on a trade that covers around $6K–$8K worth of landscaping work on your end (with me covering any difference in cash if needed). The scope above reflects a solid baseline of market value for what I'm putting in.</p>

      <p>Let me know if you want this cleaned up into a shareable page or PDF. Happy to start with whatever piece feels most urgent.</p>
